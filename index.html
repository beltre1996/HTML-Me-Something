                <h2>Tech School</h2>
                <p>The technical portion of my Air Force career began in San Angelo Texas in Goodfellow AFB. There I had to learn the fundamentals 
                of signals analysis to fulfill my duties as a 1N2C.
                For the whole 2 month period I was focused on learning and learning my trade, finally earning my money.
                Tech school turned out to be another version of college; you learn one day and make mistakes the nexts, 
                rinse and repeat. Needless to say, it was a great time and I'm glad I was there.</p>

                <h2>Fort Meade</h2>
                <p>Once I arrived at fort meade I had to sit as a "casual" for several months while I awaited my
                clearance. This was agonizing since I had just learned what was basically another language. I ended 
                eventually forgot everything I learned and was the best secretary I could be for the local legal office. 
                The time away from classified work made me appreciate the work I would finally be able to do once I badged
                into the vaunted "NSA."
                Once I was in" the building," I tore it up. Unfortunately, I can't exactly say what I did but I did great
                things to put "warheads on foreheads". Trust me.</p>

                <h4>Florida</h4>
                <p> I grew up in little Bartow, FL. "Home of the champions" they say. We actually were mostly known for being the 
                jail that housed R Kelly following his arrest for urinating on a 14 year old girl. Other than that, Bartow is
                a quiet town full of people with diverse backgrounds. It helped instill some good values in me and helped me
                become the man I am today. </p>
