                <p>The technical portion of my Air Force career began in San Angelo Texas in Goodfellow AFB. There I had to learn the fundamentals of signals analysis to fulfill my duties as a 1N2C.
                Following the 'quick' 2 months of I started using my free time away from the watchfloor to study comptia exams and learn
                anything i could online about network engineering with hopes of changing my career into a related role.</p>

                <p>After gaining certification and alot of self study, i got a new job in my new command at fort mead as a 
                network engineer supporting a sigint mission. there i learned more about somputer networking and most 
                importantly Data. I learned about how future proof a career ion data analytics could be and once again
                decided to drop what i was doing and do something else instead. I took all the online courses i could to 
                learn more about data analytics with a plan to leave the army and become an analyst.</p>
